# Vector Space #


## what is vector space ##
$R^n$ is a n-dimensional space , which contains all real column vectors with n components .

If v and w are in a **vector space S**  , every combination **cv + dw** must be in S  
 (*S is a  ($R^2$)*)


## what is subspace ##
A **subspace** of S must satisfy two requirements:
( *If v and ware vectors in the subspace and c is an scalar*)  
```
(i) v + w is in the subspace  
(ii) cv is in the subspace
```
*In other words, the set of vectors is "**closed**" under addition v + w and multiplication cv
(and dw)*


**Notice: Ever subspace contains the zero vector**


### example 1 ###
Find all subspace in $R^2$

look at the picture above,if I multiply the vector on the dash line by zero.Then I will get (0,0),which is not in the dash line obviously.  

So the subspaces of $R^2$ consist of
1. $R^2$ counts as a subspace of itself
2. any line through zero (0,0) 
3. zero point
